Widgzard is a simple module, which allows to build arbirary DOM tree through components with their own lifecycle.   

---


### Widgzard will be useful if 

- You want to render arbitrary dom trees from literal objects and attach it somewhere. 

- each component needs to exploit his own and others component lifecycle

- all components should comunicate in a clear way  

<br/>

The _Widgzard_ aims to solve the problem in a clear way, receiving a main object literal containing all is needed to get whatever is needed really fast.

### Install it  

	> npm install widgzard

### Use it

Are you crazy? 

use the `node_modules/widgzard/dist/index.js`


### Dev it

go in the `node_modules/widgzard` folder and install devDependencies for the dev build

	> cd node_modules/widgzard && npm i

then dev-build it 

	> npm run buildev

**hint**: build is a demon process that watch for relevant changes in the scource folder, also starts a small dev-srv:  
navigate to http://localhost:3001
