![postoreder walk](postorder.svg "postorder walk")


Widgzard is a simple module, which allows to build arbirary DOM tree through components with their own lifecycle.   

---


### Widgzard will be useful if 

- You want to render arbitrary dom trees from literal objects and attach it somewhere. 

- each component needs to exploit his own and others component lifecycle

- all components should comunicate in a clear way  

<br/>

The _Widgzard_ aims to solve the problem in a clear way, receiving a main object literal containing all is needed to get whatever is needed really fast.

Install dependencies  

	> npm i

then build it 

	> npm run build

**hint**: build is a demon process that for the moment (when everything seems quiet) can be shut down (ctrl+c)

It\`s time to start it  

	> npm start  

now simply go to http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:3000/samples


that's all for the moment... and obviously... to be continued !!!
