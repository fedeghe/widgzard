Widgzard is a simple module, which allows to build arbirary DOM tree through components with their own lifecycle.   

---


### Widgzard will be useful if 

- You want to render arbitrary dom trees from literal objects and attach it somewhere. 

- each component needs to exploit his own and others component lifecycle

- all components should comunicate in a clear way  

<br/>

The _Widgzard_ aims to solve the problem in a clear way, receiving a main object literal containing all is needed to get whatever is needed really fast.
